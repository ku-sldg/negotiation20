  (* [evidence] type generated by term. The argument [n] allows for multiple
     subtypes.  [EBlob 1] is a different evidenence type than [EBlob 2]. All
     this does is allow more kinds of evidence without extending this type.

     - [EBlob class] - Arbitrary evidence that can be sensitive ([red]) or
       public ([green]).
     - [EHash] - Hash value.  All hash values are [green].
     - [EPrivKey p] - Private Key for place p.  [PubKey p] is
       inverse.  Always [red] and should never be exposed.
     - [EPubKey p] - Public Key for place p. [PrivKey p] is
       inverse. Usually safe?  Will treat as always [green] for this
       experiment.
     - [ESessKey n] - Symmetric session key. [n] allows recording which
       session key in the type.  Will treat as always [red] for this
       experiment.
     - [ECrypt e p] - [e] of type [evidence] encrypted with public
       key of [p].  Always safe and [green].
     - [ESig e p] - [e] signed by [private p].  Safe if [e] is safe, so can be
       either [red] or [green]
     - [ESeq l r] - Sequential composition of evidence [l] and [r].  [green] if
       [l] and [r] are [green].
     - [EPar l r] - Parallel composition of evidence [l] and [r].  [green] if
       [l] and [r] are [green].

     [evidence] is the type corresponding with these definitions.

  (* [term] type indexed on evidence produced. Each term type captures the
     type of evidence resulting from execution.

   - [TMeas e] - gather basic evidence value.  Could be any evidence type
   - [THash e] - results in a hash.
   - [TCrypt e p] - results in an encrypted thing using place [p]'s encryption
     key. For session keys [p] can be any aribitrary value.
   - [TSig e p] - results in a signed thing using place [p]'s local signing key.
   - [TSeq e f] - [e] followed by [f]
   - [TPar e f] - [e] in parallel with [f]

  | TPar : forall e f, term e -> term f -> term (EPar e f).

  (* [term e] is indexed on [evidence] in a manner similar to an indexed abstract
     syntax for a programming language.  Every term is accompanied by the evidence
     type it produces.  Following are a few examples:
   *)
  
  Check TMeas (EBlob red).
  Definition blob := TMeas (EBlob red).
  Check (TSeq (TSig AA blob) (TPar blob (TPar blob blob))).
  Check (TSeq (TSig AA blob) (THash (TPar blob (TPar blob blob)))).
  Check THash (TMeas (EBlob red)).
  Check THash (TSig BB (TMeas (EBlob red))).
  Check (TSig BB (TMeas (EBlob red))).
  Check (TSeq (THash (TMeas (EBlob red))) (TMeas EHash)).
  Check TSeq (THash (TMeas (EBlob red))) (TSig AA (TMeas (EBlob red))).
  Check TSeq (THash (TMeas (EBlob red))) (TCrypt AA (TMeas (EBlob red))).
  Check TSeq (THash (TMeas (EPrivKey AA))) (TCrypt AA (TMeas (EBlob red))).
  Check TSeq (TMeas (EPrivKey AA)) (TCrypt AA (TMeas (EBlob red))).

  (* Blobs are things that may or may not need to be protected.  A hash
     typically will not need protection but a private key will.  There
     are various things one can do to blobs - hashing, signing, encrypting
     are the big three.  Hashing and encrypting protect blobs while signing
     does not.  Hashing always protects blobs.  Encrypting protects blobs
     unless the adversary can obtain inverse key to decrypt.

     Assume that some place [AA] has a privacy policy that does not allow any
     blob that is not a hash to be released.  The protocol:

     TSeq (THash (TMeas (EBlob red))) (TMeas EHash)
     : term (ESeq EHash EHash)

     satisfies this because its type tells us it returns a sequence of
     hashes.

     The protocol:

     TSeq (THash (TMeas (EBlob red))) (TSig AA (TMeas (EBlob 0)))
     : term (ESeq EHash (ESig (EBlob red) AA))

     does not satisfy this because its type tells us it returns a
     signature over (EBlob red) that does not protect it.

     In contrast, the protocol:
     
     TSeq (THash (TMeas (EBlob red))) (TCrypt AA (TMeas (EBlob red)))
     : term (ESeq EHash (ECrypt (EBlob red) AA))

     again satisfies this because its type tells us it returns
     an encrypted (EBlob 0) that protects it.

     Now a harder one:

     TSeq (TMeas EPrivKey) (TCrypt AA (TMeas (EBlob red)))
     : term (ESeq EPrivKey (ECrypt (EBlob red) AA))

     Literally we do not meet the requirement of only returning hashes and
     encrypted data.  But how dangerous is this protocol?  There is a private
     key returned by the first term.  Never good, but even worse if that
     private key corresponds with the encrypted blob.  Because we do not
     record whose private key this is we cannot make a strong assessment.
     
     Changing the definition of EPrivKey just a bit allows a stronger
     assessment:

     TSeq (TMeas (EPrivKey AA)) (TCrypt AA (TMeas (EBlob red)))
     : term (ESeq (EPrivKey AA) (ECrypt (EBlob red) AA))

     Here EPrivKey records whose private key is being reported.  Now we know
     this is particularly dangerous.  While this is a rather contrived
     example, remember that we are trying to prevent errors in attestation
     protocols, not prevent adversaries from writing hostile protocols.
