# All code relating to negotiation exists here. 

All formal models are realized in Coq with version 8.16.0. 

## Refinement 

Formal models pertaining to refinement. Includes definition of manfiests and proofs of executability. Also includes soundness definitions and proofs. 

## Selection 

Formal models of interest describe protocol orderings. We believe that the protocols can be ordered to form a lattice whereby the top of the lattice is the situationally best protocol. 

## DeptTypes 

All code from "A Type Dependent Policy Language". This include a dependently typed privacy policy and selection policy for the target. This is information relative to Fritz thesis (2019). Such code is no longer used but kept for reference if needed. 

## Haskell_Implementation

A working negotation stub in Haskell.
