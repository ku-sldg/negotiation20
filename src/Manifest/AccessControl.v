(* Reasoning about Access Control. Motivated by paper titled "Model Checking Distributed Mandatory Access Control Policies" 

Motivation : We need to be able to know if an AM can request measurement from another AM (measures relation). At the requested AM, we need to know if they can access a specific resource in the context of a certain appraiser. 

Goal: create a type system to describe the target of measurement (objects) and the ASPs preforming measurement.
