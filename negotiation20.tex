\section{Introduction}

\citet{Martin:08:The-ten-page-in} defines trust as unambiguous
identification, unhindered operation, and direct observation of good
behavior or indirect observation by a trusted third party.  Semantic
remote attestation~\cite{Haldar:04:Semantic-Remote} is a technique by
which a target provides evidence used to establish trust in its
execution.  Shown in figure~\ref{fig:architecture-fig} an
\emph{appraiser} makes a request ($r:R$) of a \emph{target} where
attestation then generates and returns evidence ($e:E$) that is
appraised to determine trust.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]

\end{figure}

\citet{Coker::Principles-of-R,Coker:08:Attestation:-Ev} define a
remote attestation model where a target executes an \emph{attestation
  protocol} that gathers evidence and generates meta-evidence for
appraisal.  The protocol sequences the execution of attestation
services that perform measurement, generate cryptographic signatures,
and make requests of other systems. These protocols are executed by an
\emph{attestation manager} associated with the appraiser or target.

\todo[inline] {Do we need to include the 5 principles of remote
  attestation?}

Figure~\ref{fig:sequence-fig} illustrates the process of negotiating
and executing an attestation protocol.  An appraiser and target first
establish a security association that identifies appraiser and target,
sets up secure communication, and establishes a security domain
providing context for negotiation.  The appraiser then sends a request
to the target describing the evidence and meta-evidence it needs for
appraisal.  The target produces a proposal consisting of a protocol
set that responds to the request while obeying the target's local
policy. Based on the selection policy, the appraiser chooses a
protocol from the proposal that the target then executes.  The
resulting evidence is returned to the appraiser and evaluated to
determine trust.

%% just decribe whats in it. domain which defines vocabulary

The negotiation of an attestation protocol satisfying the requirements
of the appraiser and restrictions of the target is our objective here.
Following we will formally define a negotiation process, define
properties of an ideal protocol, and show that the negotiation process
produces ideal protocols.  We will then instantiate the model for
several systems to provide examples of its use.

\section{Attestation Protocols}

An attestation protocol is formally a sequence of attestation actions
that can include gathering evidence in sequence and parallel,
generating cryptographic signatures, and requesting attestation
results from other attestation managers.  Our representation for such
protocols uses Copland~\citep{Ramsdell:2019aa} which provides a
convenient language for modeling and execution as well as a formal
semantics for verification.

%% something about evidence and metaevidence somewhere

Terms define a single attestation instance. The appraiser requests a \emph{User
  Space Measurement} (USM), a \emph{Kernel Integrity Measurement}
(KIM), or a combination of both. A USM
provides evidence of a local user space while a KIM makes claims
about an external system. The appraiser then requests evidence of the user space or kernal through protocols.  Protocols are built from a miminal set of operations that
include copying, signing, and hashing evidence values. They are
encoded as CPY, SIG, and HSH respectively. The variable for place, p, for place of measurement is also declared in the protocol with a natural number.

Phrases define a sequence of one or more terms and can be combined
in three ways for sequential or parallel execution to enforce an
evaluation ordering. The first way is using linear sequencing to
ensure one term, $T_1$, executes before a second term, $T_2$. This
operation is denoted using the $\linseqe$ symbol and is encoded as
$(T_1\linseqe T_2)$. Next, Copland allows the use of a pair of
projection function $\pi$ to specifically split the evidence between
term when executing in sequence or in parallel. An example of $\pi$ is
$\pi = (\emph{id} , \bot) $ where all evidence is sent to $T_1$ and
$T_2$ executes with no prior evidence. $(T_1\braseqe\pi T_2)$ states
that the goal is sequential execution where $T_1$ evaluates before
$T_2$ with the specificed evidence splitting
operation. $(T_1\brapare\pi T_2)$ describes a phrase where $T_1$ and
$T_2$ can execute in parallel with evidence splitting.


\todo[inline]{section should continue and define/describe Copland
  protocols.  Important concepts are ASPs, protocols, evidence and
  meta-evidence}

Additionally, while each attestation manager is responsible for
providing evidence of a target system's state, they are also
responsible for providing meta-evidence. While evidence is the
tangible result of attestation, meta-evidence assures the appraiser
that evidence was gathered correctly. Together, evidence and
meta-evidence result in an accurate depiction of the current state of the target
system.



\section{Protocol Negotiation}

To begin negotiation, a security association (SA) must be established to allow the parties communicate with the same vocabulary. More
precisely, a SA establishes identification, keys, security labels, domain of interpretation, situational awareness and lifetime. To enstanciate
the SA, an appriaser sends a request to the target where, through
ISAKMP, the target responds with the certificate validating the
security association. Communcation between the two parties can then
occur under a common domain of interpretation.

For the purposes of this discussion we will assume the establishment
of a security association between appraiser and target and begin with
the appraiser sending a request to the target.  We define $A$ as the
type of appraisers and $T$ the type of targets.  $R$ is the type of
attestation requests that define the needs of the appraiser.  $P$ is
the type of protocols represented as Copland phrases.  $E$ is the type
of evidence generated by protocol execution.

Ideally the appraiser $a:A$ makes a request $r:R$ of some target
$t:T$, a protocol $p:P$ is selected and executed buy $t$ returning
evidence $e:E$ for evaluation by $a$.  Selection of $p$ is achieved by
finding the ``best'' protocol that satisfies the needs of the
appraiser while respecting the privacy of the target. The notion of
``best'' is situationally dependent and can change for different
attestation scenarios, targets and appraisers.  Furthermore, the
preferences and policies of targets and appraisers are not and should
not be globally known.  Thus, negotiation between $a$ and $t$ is
essential for finding a ``best'' protocol.

Figure~\ref{fig:sequence-fig} graphically shows the negotiation
process for finding a best $p$ given a request $r$ and a collection of
available protocols, $P$.

We define $\langle P \rangle$ as vectors of protocols representing
\emph{proposals}.  When an appraiser makes a request, the target
returns some $q:\langle P \rangle$ whose protocols fully or partially
satisfy the request. The target chooses and orders
$q:\langle P\rangle$ by examining evidence produced by executing
protocols defined by Copland's evidence semantics $\mathcal{E}$.

Two factors influence the production of $p$.  The target's \emph{local
  policy} defines limits on the evidence it will provide.  Local
policy $\pi : A\times E$ is a relation among appraisers and evidence.
$(a,e)\in\pi$ implies that appraiser $a$ has permission to receive
evidence $e$.  Thus, $\{e:E\mid (a,e)\in\pi\}$ is the evidence set a
target can return to $a$.

The target's negotiation policy defines an ordering over evidence and
indirectly an ordering over protocols.  The partially ordered set
$(E,\preceq)$ defines the target's preference for one evidence set
over another. $e_1\preceq e_2$ expresses a preference for $e_2$ over
$e_1$.  Taken further, if $(E,\preceq,\top,\bot)$ defines a lattice,
then $E$ and every subset of $E$ has one or more maxima.  Those maxima
define best or most preferred evidence.

Combining a request, local policy, and evidence preference results in
a lattice of evidence satisfying the request:

\[(\{e:E\mid (a,e)\in\pi_T\},\preceq_T,\top_T,\bot_T)\]

If $\mathcal{E}[\![p]\!]=e$ for some protocol $p$ then a similar
lattice for protocols results:

\[(\{p:P\mid
  (a,\mathcal{E}[\![p]\!]=e)\in\pi_T\},\preceq_T,\top_T,\bot_T)\]

\todo[inline]{stopped here for the evening.  what's above tries to
  reflect our discussions, but is not there yet.  several things need
  to be decided.  Also some redundant stuff follows.}

Elements of a proposal $\langle P\rangle$ are generated by
$(\mathsf{map}\; \mathcal{E}\; \langle P\rangle)$ where $\mathcal{E}$
is the Copland evidence semantics defined by \citet{Ramsdell:2019aa}.
Thus, a proposal can be mapped onto the various evidence that each
protocol produces.

Figure~\ref{fig:sequence-fig} defines the process of protocol
negotiation and execution.  $r:R$ is sent from appraiser to target.
The target responds with a $q:\langle P\rangle$ defining potential
protocols.  The appraiser chooses one protocol, $p:P$, by direct
selection and instantiation of a parameterized protocol.  That
protocol is then executed by the target and evidence, $e:E$, returned
to the appraiser.  The evidence is then appraised to determine trust.

\section{Negotiation Verification}

Knowing that a request $r:R$ produces evidence, we can send a request
through the attestation manager to generate all possible pieces of
evidence. From that resulting vector of evidence, a situationally
dependent ordering will be imposed and one piece of evidence will be
deemed ``best''. This ``best'' piece of evidence represents the top of
the lattice. As seen in figure 3, this procedure is described using
the top arrow where the $r:R$ generates a vector of evidence. We will
then move backwards through the certification figure to enforce an
ordering over the possible pieces of evidence $\langle E \rangle$,
undoing appraisal. We can take the ordering of evidence and order the
possible protocols generated from the request. This repensents the
appraiser's ordering of protocols, creating the appraiser's
lattice. After the request is sent, we can then compare the
appraiser's protocol ordering to the target's proposal. The protocol
selected for attestation will be the one that is ``best'' for the
appraiser and that is included in the target's proposal.

\section{Applications}

\begin{itemize}
\item Single protocol example
\item Protocol shapes examples
\item Complex evidence example

\end{itemize}

  
In this section, we attempt to describe the outcome of various
negotiation scenarios with examples of the appraiser's request and
target's response. In all subsequent cases, assume the appraiser
requests a user space measurement, USM, from place one, to provide a
hash of the virus checker, vc. Unless otherwise noted, the request
will look like $@_1 (\text{USM}\: hash$ vc).

The first example is one such that negotation occurs ``perfectly''
where the targets proposal includes the exact protocol requested. In
this \gls{perfect} scenario, the target will respond with
$@_1 (\text{USM}\: hash$ vc) and possibly some other collection of
Copland terms. The appraiser will implement the selection policy to
find the exact protocol is present in the intersection poset and
select that for attestation. This is called perfect negotiation.

Upon recieving a request, the target could choose to expose all
information by responding with every possible protocol it can generate
so the decision of the correct protocol for attestation is given to
the appriser. In choosing, the appriser will implement its selection
policy to obtain the most effective protocol(s). This is situation is
defined to be \gls{Ideal} as the target is willing to expose all
components of its architecutre.

If the request results in an empty intersection poset, the target
fails negotiation. This situation may occurs when the target cannot
find a protocol to satisfy the request or the target responds with a
proposal of protocols unrelated to the request. In either case, the
appraiser assumes the system is not trusted. It may restart
negotiation with a new request as a separate scenario.

There is also a possiblity that target returns two completely
unrelated pieces of evidence where the appriser must decide which is
more suitable for attestation. For example, if the request is still a
hash of the virus checker, this proposal would then include a hash of
the signature server and a hash of its own attestation manager,
am. This proposal would look like {$@_1 (\text{USM}\: hash$ ss),
  $@_1 (\text{USM}\: hash$ am)}. In either case, the appraiser must
apply its selection policy to attain if the protocols meet the
situational requirements and choose which should be selected for
attestation.

%% It is possible that the target responds with protocols in an
%% unfavorable pairing such that the target is willing to give the
%% exact thing requested but only if it is bundled with other unwanted
%% pieces of evidence.

Unrelated to the specific protocols examples, if the target takes too
long to respond to the appriser's request the negotiation situation
fails. This idea can be enforced through the security association as
there is a lifetime header where the target and the appraiser agree on
the duration that the SA is valid. If the process of negotiation
outlasts the time that the security assoication is valid then
negotiation fails and target is deemed untrusted or negotiation must
restart.

\section{Conclusions}

We have presented a model for negotiating attestation protocols that
both meet local policy requirements while producing evidence
satisfying appraiser requirements.
