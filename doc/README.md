# Documents 

## Copland Summit 

Copland summit was a meeting between KU, NSA, MITRE, and JHAPL. We discussed the Copland language and the status of each team's work. This document realizes some of that discussion. 

## NFM 2023

We wrote a paper titled "A Framework for Policy Based Negotiation" which formalizes the negotiation protocol. We introduced the idea of Manifests and using them to caputer attestation manager specific information. We formally captured the request. We introduced the verification stack and defined `Executability`, `Privacy Policy`, `Soundness`, `Sufficiency`, and `Negotiation Correctness`. We concluded the paper with a motivating example around a virus checker measurement.   

Current Status: submitted on Jan 6, 2023. Should hear back about the paper in early March. 

Bonus fact: Anna's first attempt at a publication ðŸ¥³

## Request Musing 

In Fall of 2022, we were unsure of what the request should include. These were some of Anna's thoughts. 

## Negotiating Protocols UNPUBLISHED 

This was our first attempt at a paper during Anna's thesis. This writing framed the NFM paper but still, there are some other good thoughts there about negotiation in general.
