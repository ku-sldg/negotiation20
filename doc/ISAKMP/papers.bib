abstract = {Client-Server applications have become the backbone of the Internet and are processing
increasingly sensitive information. We have come to rely on the correct behavior and
trustworthiness of online banking, online shopping, and other remote access services.
These services are implemented as cooperating processes on different platforms. To
trust distributed services, one must trust each cooperating process and their interconnection.Common
practice today is to establish secure tunnels to protect the communication between
local and remote processes. Typically, a user controls the local system. The user
also controls the security of the tunnel through negotiation and authentication protocols.
Ongoing and published work examines how to create and monitor properties of remote
systems. What is missing is the link or binding between such properties and the actual
remote tunnel endpoint.We examine here how to link specific properties of a remote
system "gained through TPM-based attestation" to secure tunnel endpoints to counter
attacks where a compromised authenticated SSL endpoint relays the TPM-based attestation
to another system. We show how the proposed mechanism can be deployed in virtualized
environments to create inexpensive SSL endpoint certificates and instant revocation
that scales Internet-wide.},
